# Airport Management API

## API service for airport management built with DRF and Dockerized



This Airport Management API supports JWT authentication, email-based login, and an admin panel. Users can manage their own orders, while staff handle flights, routes, airplanes, etc. Key features include filtering, validation to prevent errors (e.g., overbooking, duplicate tickets), and secure data storage with Docker volumes. API documentation is available via Swagger and Redoc.
